Assignment 1 Description

You have been hired by King Real Estate to develop
a Web site for their company.  They want to make sure 
they like your work so they will break the project
up into parts and have you develop one part at a time.

You need to develop a form to collect customer data 
for a guest book.  For this first phase, you do
not need to save the data entered at all... just 
display it on a Web page.

Make sure your Web Application meets the following 
criteria:

1.  Put the King Real Estate logo at the top
of the page.

2.  The customer should be able to enter their
first and last name in separte fields.

3.  Let the customer make a choice on whether
they would like to be contacted with their phone
number or email and let them enter that information
only.

4.  King Real Estate only serves the following
cities:  Chicago, Detroit, and Toronto.  They
should only be able to choose amoung those
cities for potential places to live.

5.  Allow the user to enter comments.

6.  Prove a submit button to send this
information to the server.


After the customer clicks the submit button:

1.  Collect the information entered by the user.

2.  Redisplay the information entered by the user
being sure to indicate their phone number or email,
depending on what they entered in the form.

3.  The top of the page should include the company
logo and a Thank You.  Also, let them know that
a representative will contact them soon.

4.  Be sure to display their comments in the same
format as they entered them but don't let them
make any further changes to the text.
